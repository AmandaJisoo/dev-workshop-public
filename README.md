# Dev Workshop

### Instruction on how to get the project up and running
* Clone the repository into any folder of your choice using ```git clone <LINK TO THE REPO>``` (this link to the repo can be found by clicking on the "Clone or download" button).
* Next go into the project folder and then server folder inside it by running the commands ```cd dev-workshop-public``` and ```cd server``` respectively. These two commands can be combined into one using forward slash or back slash depending on whether you are using MacOS or Windows.
